      -- I found the following algorithm provides a very good statistical distribution.
      -- Each input bit affects each output bit with about 50% probability.
      -- There are no collisions (each input results in a different output).
      -- The algorithm is fast except if the CPU doesn't have a
      -- built-in Int32_T multiplication unit. C-Code:
      --
      --  unsigned int hash(unsigned int x) {
      --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
      --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
      --      x = (x >> 16) ^ x;
      --      return x;
      --  }
      --
      -- The magic number was calculated using a special multi-threaded
      -- test program that ran for many hours, which calculates the avalanche effect
      -- (the number of output bits that change if a single input bit is changed;
      -- should be nearly 16 on average), independence of output bit changes
      -- (output bits should not depend on each other), and the probability of a change
      -- in each output bit if any input bit is changed. The calculated values are better
      -- than the 32-bit finalizer used by MurmurHash, and nearly as good (not quite) as when using AES.
