   --  what-Int32-hash-function-are-good-that-accepts-an-Int32-hash-key
   --
   --  I found the following algorithm provides
   --  a very good statistical distribution.
   --  Each input bit affects each output bit with about 50% probability.
   --  There are no collisions (each input results in a different output).
   --  The algorithm is fast except if the CPU doesn't have a
   --  built-in Int32 multiplication unit. C-Code:
   --
   --  unsigned int hash(unsigned int x) {
   --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
   --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
   --      x = (x >> 16) ^ x;
   --      return x;
   --  }
   --
   --  The magic number was calculated using a special multi-threaded
   --  test program that ran for many hours,
   --  which calculates the avalanche effect
   --  (the number of output bits that change if a single input bit is changed;
   --  should be nearly 16 on average), independence of output bit changes
   --  (output bits should not depend on each other),
   --  and the probability of a change in each output bit if any input bit
   --  is changed. The calculated values are better than the 32-bit finalizer
   --   used by MurmurHash, and nearly as good (not quite) as when using AES.
