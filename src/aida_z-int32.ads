   -- Calculates the hash of an 32-bit integer based upon the following post
   -- on Stackoverlow:
   -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/664014/what-integer-hash-function-are-good-that-accepts-an-integer-hash-key
   --
   -- I found the following algorithm provides a very good statistical distribution.
   -- Each input bit affects each output bit with about 50% probability.
   -- There are no collisions (each input results in a different output).
   -- The algorithm is fast except if the CPU doesn't have a
   -- built-in integer multiplication unit. C-Code:
   --
   --  unsigned int hash(unsigned int x) {
   --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
   --      x = ((x >> 16) ^ x) * 0x45d9f3b;
   --      x = (x >> 16) ^ x;
   --      return x;
   --  }
   --
   -- The magic number was calculated using a special multi-threaded
   -- test program that ran for many hours, which calculates the avalanche effect
   -- (the number of output bits that change if a single input bit is changed;
   -- should be nearly 16 on average), independence of output bit changes
   -- (output bits should not depend on each other), and the probability of a change
   -- in each output bit if any input bit is changed. The calculated values are better
   -- than the 32-bit finalizer used by MurmurHash, and nearly as good (not quite) as when using AES.
