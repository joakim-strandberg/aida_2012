   --      <value> starts immediately after the character '=' and ends with the
   --      character immediately preceding the next comma (',') or with the
   --      last character of the parameter.
   --
   --      The allowed values for preserve= are:
   --
   --        no_attributes:  Do not try to preserve any file attributes. This
   --                        is the default if no preserve= is found in Form.
   --
   --        all_attributes: Try to preserve all file attributes (timestamps,
   --                        access rights).
   --
   --        timestamps:     Preserve the timestamp of the copied file, but not
   --                        the other file attributes.
   --
   --      The allowed values for mode= are:
   --
   --        copy:           Only copy if the destination file does not already
   --                        exist. If it already exists, Copy_File will fail.
   --
   --        overwrite:      Copy the file in all cases. Overwrite an already
   --                        existing destination file. This is the default if
   --                        no mode= is found in Form.
   --
   --        append:         Append the original file to the destination file.
   --                        If the destination file does not exist, the
   --                        destination file is a copy of the source file.
   --                        When mode=append, the field preserve=, if it
   --                        exists, is not taken into account.
   --
   --    If the Form parameter includes one or both of the fields and the value
   --    or values are incorrect, Copy_File fails with Use_Error.
   --
   --    Examples of correct Forms:
   --       Form => "preserve=no_attributes,mode=overwrite" (the default)
   --       Form => "mode=append"
   --       Form => "mode=copy,preserve=all_attributes"
   --
   --    Examples of incorrect Forms:
   --       Form => "preserve=junk"
   --       Form => "mode=internal,preserve=timestamps"
